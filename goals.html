                    <p class="text-center pt-4">My immediate short-term goals are to secure an internship in the tech industry. I am hoping to gain real world experience and expand my personal skillset to propel me into my career. To achieve this, I am currently searching around Ohio for computer science internships and using connections to amplify my chance of gaining an internship.  My next relatively short-term goal will be completing college and finishing with a bachelor’s in computer science and engineering. This will be a major milestone in my academic career that will enhance my career opportunities.</p>

                    <p class="text-center pt-4">My long-term plans are to become an  artificial intelligence researcher. I have always been fascinated by what computers can accomplish with just a few basic commands and where we can go in the future. Developing the next big thing will probably come from artificial intelligence or a similar field. I want to be a part of the next big step. To accomplish this plan, I am specializing in AI at OSU. Taking courses and doing personal research will build my skillset now for future opportunities and research.</p>
