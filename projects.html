                    <p class="text-center pt-4">My first semester at OSU I was part of an engineering team for Fundamentals of Engineering course. For our semester project we were tasked with developing a battleship like video game in MATLAB with advertisement material and a full project write up. I was personally tasked with writing the MATLAB code for the battleship video game. I utilized the display graphics library and developed all the underlying mechanics and AI for the game. Testing and developing the AI algorithm for a player to play against helped me expand my skillset and learn every possible strategy for battleship.</p>

                    <p class="text-center pt-4">My second semester at OSU I was part of an engineering team for Fundamentals of Engineering II course. The entirety of the semester was devoted towards creating and prototyping and creating a new mode of transportation around OSU’s campus and Columbus, Ohio. Due to the increase in traffic we decided to develop a monorail system that can move a lot of people safely and avoid vehicle traffic. We then expanded on the idea to add solar panels and other clean energy technologies along the routes and at each stop. </p>

                    <p class="text-center pt-4">Over the course of spring semester of 2020, I wanted to expand my web development knowledge. I decided to develop from scratch a backend, frontend, and routing for a custom domain and webservices. I developed a NodeJS backend and secure routing tables for other web services. I also developed a demo website that I served though the NodeJS server. This project allowed me to experiment with web technologies that I had not previously been exposed to and added something to demonstrate for job interviews. I enjoyed developing it and will continue to add to it.  </p>
